## Introduction

The April 2015 Nepal earthquake killed almost 9,000 people and was one of the worst natural disasters to strike Nepal in a century, causing widespread destruction of buildings and mass homelessness. Today’s data represent one of the largest post-disaster datasets ever collected, being made available by Kathmandu Living Labs and the Central Bureau of Statistics.

The goal of the project is to predict damage_grade, an ordinal variable which corresponds to the level of damage sustained by each building in the earthquake. 1 represents “low” damage, 2 represents moderate damage, and 3 represents severe damage.

There are numerous varables included in the dataset, below are comprehensive lists of the features and their distributions:

-   Numeric Variables:: geo_level_1_id, geo_level_2_id, geo_level_3_id, count_floors_pre_eq, age, area_percentage, height_percentage, count_families.

-   Numeric Plots:

-   Categorical Variables: land_surface_condition, foundation_type, roof_type, other_floor_type, plan_configuration, has_superstructure_mud_mortar_stone, has_superstructure_stone_flag, has_superstructure_mud_mortar_brick, has_superstructure_cement_mortar_brick, has_superstructure_timber, has_superstructure_bamboo, has_superstructure_rc_non_engineered, has_superstructure_rc_engineered, has_superstructure_other, legal_ownership_status, has_secondary_use, has_secondary_use_agriculture, has_secondary_use_hotel, has_secondary_use_rental, has_secondary_use_institution, has_secondary_use_school, has_secondary_use_industry, has_secondary_use_health_post, has_secondary_use_gov_office, has_secondary_use_use_police, has_secondary_use_other.

## Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering

Before proceeding to modeling, it is important for us to keep track of missing values as well as response variable imbalancing issue.

We checked the number of missing values for every column in the data-set and realized that there are no missing values at all, allowing us to proceed to imbalancing detection of response variable (damage_grade).

We checked the current proportions of sample belonging to the three damage grades and observed that there are 9.6% of samples belonging to damage_grade = 1, 56.88% of samples belonging to damage_grade = 2, and 33.52% of samples belonging to damage_grade = 3.

While proportions of samples belonging to damage_grade = 2, 3 are not concerning, there are far less samples in damage_grade = 1 and thus our models might over-fit features from samples in damage_grade = 2 or 3. In order to mitigate such issue, we utilized SMOTE to raise the proportion of samples belong to damage_grade = 1 by making fake identities with possible features of real samples with damage_grade = 1. After SMOTE, the proportions of samples belonging to each damage grade is - "damage_grade = 1" : 32.57%, "damage_grade = 2" : 42.43%, "damage_grade = 3" : 25%.

Finally, to avoid potential modeling bias from large scaled numerical variables, we used standard scaling to keep all numerical variables between 0 and 1. After scaling, the numeral variables have following distributions:
